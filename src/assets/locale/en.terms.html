    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 30, 2019</p>

    <p>PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THIS TAPNPAY LICENSE AND USE AGREEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT IS A LEGALLY BINDING
        CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND AETOLLS, LLC ("<strong class="text-underline">AET</strong>") REGARDING YOUR USE OF THE TAPNPAY SERVICE (THE
        "<strong class="text-underline">SERVICE</strong>").</p>

    <p><strong>BY CLICKING "I ACCEPT," OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE</strong>, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ
        AND UNDERSTOOD, AND, AS A CONDITION TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY, THE
        FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING AET"S PRIVACY POLICY (TOGETHER, THIS "<strong class="text-underline">AGREEMENT</strong>"). If you
        are not eligible, or do not agree to these terms and conditions, then you do not have our permission
        to use the Service.</p>

    <p><strong>ARBITRATION NOTICE.</strong> Except for certain kinds of disputes described in Section 12.2 ,
        you agree that disputes arising under this Agreement will be resolved by binding, individual
        arbitration, and BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND AET ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY
        JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR
        RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract (except for matters that
        may be taken to small claims court). Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT
        a judge or jury.</p>

    <ol class="list list_section">
        <li>Overview. The Service allows you to add toll charges (collectively, "Tolls"; each, a "Toll")
            owed to operators of associated toll facilities (such operators being called "ATFOs" and each,
            individually, being an "ATFO") directly to your mobile phone carrier ("Carrier") bill. The
            Service links your vehicle"s license plate number(s) (each, an "LPN") to your mobile phone
            number from an eligible Carrier (" Mobile Phone Number ") as an alternative payment method for
            Pay-by-Mail invoices sent by ATFOs. Tolls incurred for a vehicle whose LPN is linked to your
            mobile phone number will be paid directly to the ATFO by AET, and AET will be reimbursed for
            those payments from your payment of your Carrier"s bill that includes those Tolls.
        </li>
        <li>This is Not an Agreement with an ATFO. You expressly acknowledge and agree that: (a) this
            Agreement is strictly between you and AET; (b) it is not an agreement between you and any ATFO;
            and (c) it does not give you any rights or remedies against or with respect to an ATFO. You
            further expressly acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Agreement modifies any rights or
            responsibilities you may have with respect to the payment of Tolls, administrative fees, or any
            other charges for which you are liable to an ATFO under applicable law. Under applicable law,
            the registered owner of a vehicle that uses an ATFO"s toll facility is liable for payment to the
            AFTO of a Toll. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, AET agrees to pay the
            Toll on your behalf to the applicable ATFO, but if AET fails or is not obligated under this
            Agreement to pay the Toll, the registered owner of the vehicle that incurs the Toll will remain
            liable to the ATFO to pay the Toll and any administrative fees or other charges resulting from a
            failure to pay the Toll within the payment period provided by law. You irrevocably agree not to
            pursue against an ATFO any claim, cause of action, or other remedy available to you for or
            arising out of or in connection with AET"s failure to comply with this Agreement, and you hereby
            acknowledge and agree that no ATFO shall be liable for any failure or default by AET under this
            Agreement. Nothing in this Section 2 impairs any claims or other rights you may have against AET
            for its failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.
        </li>

        <li>Beta Service.If you are granted access to a beta (pre-release or limited release) version of the
            Services (the "Beta Service"), then your use of the Beta Service is subject to the following
            additional terms and conditions in this Section 3 (the "Beta Terms"). For clarity, use of the
            Beta Service remains subject to all other terms and conditions of this Agreement except that, to
            the extent there is a conflict between the Beta Terms and other terms in this Agreement, these
            Beta Terms will prevail with respect to the Beta Service.
            <ol class="list list_section">
                <li>Beta Disclaimer. The Beta Service is offered by AET as a pre-release version for limited
                    use on
                    an
                    as-is basis, solely for testing, evaluation, and feedback purposes. The Beta Service may
                    not
                    operate
                    correctly and may be substantially modified prior to commercial release, or at AET"s
                    option, may
                    not
                    be released commercially in the future. If AET chooses to offer subsequent beta or other
                    versions of
                    the Service, such subsequent versions or services may be subject to additional terms and
                    conditions.
                    AET reserves the right to terminate the Beta Service at any time.

                    the Beta Service.
                </li>
                <li>Incentives. During the Beta Service period, we may offer you promotional incentives by
                    which we
                    assume the obligation to pay without reimbursement a portion of the Tolls invoiced to
                    you via
                    the
                    Beta Service, as further described on the Beta Service. Incentives may be capped at
                    specified
                    dollar
                    values. After reaching the incentive cap or limit, you will remain a customer with
                    payment
                    obligations for the full amount of Tolls invoiced to your Carrier unless you elect to
                    deregister
                    from the Beta Service.

                <li>Eligibility. You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service. By accepting this
                    Agreement, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 18 years old; (b)
                    you
                    have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; (c) your registration
                    and
                    your use of the Service is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and

                    authority to grant to AET all rights and permissions granted under this Agreement. If
                    you
                    perform any fraudulent activity in connection with your use of the Service, including
                    without limitation (i) impersonating another person, (ii) charging Tolls to the Carrier
                    account of another person or entity without authorization or (iii) disputing Tolls in
                    bad
                    faith, you will be subject to prosecution, including by the applicable ATFO, under all
                    appropriate laws of the state(s) and municipalities in which the ATFO operates.
                </li>
                <li>Registration. You must establish a tapNpay account (" Account ") with AET in order to
                    use the
                    Service. To register, you must link your LPN to your Mobile Phone Number. You can
                    register
                    multiple vehicles to the same Mobile Phone Number, to a maximum of twelve (12) LPNs per
                    Account, but one LPN cannot be linked to more than one Mobile Phone Number. Upon
                    successful
                    account verification with your Carrier, the set-up and registration process with the
                    ATFO
                    can take up to 1 business day to be completed. You may still receive pay-by-mail
                    invoices
                    from the ATFO for Tolls incurred during the period prior to your registration being
                    fully
                    processed, and you will be solely responsible for paying all such invoices directly to
                    the
                    ATFO. Once your Account is established, you will be electronically notified and invoiced
                    for
                    all Tolls incurred at all participating ATFO facilities and for all the vehicles
                    registered
                    and linked to your Mobile Phone Number account with your Carrier. The Service may not be
                    available for non-ATFO facilities, such as airport parking and certain toll roads not
                    within
                    the participating ATFO"s service area, such as Managed Lanes, Express Lanes, and
                    TEXpress
                    lanes. You may receive an invoice from an ATFO for travel on a facility not
                    participating in
                    the Service, which you are obligated to pay to the ATFO who issued the invoice.
                </li>
                <li>Carrier Eligibility. Registration may not be allowed based on your Carrier or your
                    selected
                    plan with your Carrier. If your Carrier participates in the Service, your Mobile Phone
                    Number account must be in good standing at the time of your registration in order to use
                    the
                    Service and must remain in good standing to participate in the Service. During the
                    system
                    registration process, your phone number will be verified to ensure that: (a) the LPN
                    that
                    you are trying to register is not already linked to another Mobile Phone Number, and (b)
                    that your Carrier account status is in good standing. Your acceptance of this agreement
                    constitutes your permission for AET to obtain limited information from your Carrier and
                    the
                    ATFOs necessary to establish and maintain your Account. If your LPN is already
                    registered to
                    a different Mobile Phone Number, AET will attempt to contact the previous user of that
                    Mobile Phone Number to request permission to de-link or un-register the LPN. AET will
                    promptly notify you if the LPN is cleared to allow the registration process to be
                    re-started. Once registered, please note that if you change Carriers or plans it may
                    affect
                    your registration status and ability to use the Service. Your Carrier may impose
                    transaction
                    or dollar amount limits on your use of the Service. If a charge is rejected by your
                    Carrier,
                    we will notify you of such rejection, but you are solely responsible for resolving the
                    issue
                    with your Carrier, or, in the alternative, paying the Toll directly to the applicable
                    ATFO.
                </li>
                <li>Changes to Your Account. By registering for an Account, you are accepting responsibility
                    for
                    all Tolls incurred by each LPN you register to your Account, regardless of whether or
                    not
                    you are the registered owner of the vehicle with those LPNs and even if someone other
                    than
                    you uses the vehicle. You are responsible for ensuring that your Account information is
                    accurate and up-to-date. You agree that if you fail to keep your Account information
                    up-to-date, AET may use other services or resources to verify and update your Account
                    information, including, without limitation, your Carrier and vehicle information. You
                    may
                    use the tapNpay website available at https://tapnpay.biz (the "TapNpay Site") to change
                    or
                    update your Account information, add LPNs to your Account, remove LPNs from your
                    Account,
                    view your Account balance, view transactions posted to your Account, or terminate your
                    Account.
                </li>
                <li>Stolen or Sold Vehicle . If the vehicle associated with your LPN is sold or stolen, you
                    are
                    responsible for promptly updating your Account. Except as provided in this Section, you
                    will
                    be liable for all Tolls incurred by the vehicle assigned to the LPN associated with your
                    Account . However, if a vehicle assigned to the LPN associated with your Account passes
                    through a tolling point when the vehicle was either (i) stolen and you have reported the
                    theft to the appropriate law enforcement authority within the time required under
                    applicable

        <li>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
            <ol class="list list_section">
                <li>Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and AET in the most
                    expedient
                    and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 12.2, you and AET agree
                    that
                    every dispute arising between you and AET in connection with this Agreement will be
                    resolved
                    by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration
                    uses
                    a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery
                    than
                    in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the
                    same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes
                    includes all claims between you and AET arising out of or relating to any aspect of this
                    Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any
                    other
                    legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination
                    of
                    this Agreement. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND
                    AET
                    ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
                </li>
                <li>Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section 12.1, nothing in this Agreement will be
                    deemed
                    to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an
                    individual
                    action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable
                    federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief
                    in a
                    court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an
                    intellectual property infringement claim. Also, as provided in Section 2, nothing in
                    this
                    Agreement, including, but not limited to, this Section 12, is binding on or creates
                    obligations or limitations with respect to an ATFO.
                </li>
                <li>Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and AET will be settled under the Federal
                    Arbitration
                    Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer
                    Arbitration Rules (collectively, " AAA Rules ") as modified by this Agreement. The AAA
                    Rules
                    and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at
                    1-800-778-7879,
                    or by contacting AET. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute
                    relating
                    to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration
                    agreement.
                </li>
                <li>Notice of Arbitration; Process . A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send
                    a
                    written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal
                    Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current
                    physical address, then by electronic mail ("Notice of Arbitration"). AET"s address for
                    Notice is: AETolls, LLC, 1011 W. Monroe St., Austin, Texas 78704. The Notice of
                    Arbitration
                    must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the
                    specific relief sought ("Demand"). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve
                    the
                    claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days
                    after
                    the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or AET may commence an arbitration
                    proceeding.
                    All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise
                    agreed
                    by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer
                    made
                    by you or AET must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a
                    final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the
                    last written settlement amount offered by AET in settlement of the dispute prior to the
                    award, AET will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or
                    (ii)
                    $10,000.
                </li>
                <li>Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with this Agreement, AET will reimburse
                    you
                    for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which
                    case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing
                    will
                    take place at a location to be agreed upon in Travis County, Texas, but if the claim is
                    for
                    $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on
                    the
                    basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based
                    telephone
                    hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county
                    (or
                    parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of
                    your
                    claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose
                    (as
                    measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the
                    payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to
                    reimburse
                    AET for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay
                    under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the
                    arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential
                    findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The
                    arbitrator
                    may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or
                    expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made
                    within 14
                    days of the arbitrator"s ruling on the merits.
                </li>
                <li>No Class Actions. YOU AND AET AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN
                    YOUR
                    OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS
                    OR
                    REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and AET agree otherwise, the
                    arbitrator
                    may not consolidate more than one person"s claims, and may not otherwise preside over
                    any
                    form of a representative or class proceeding.
                </li>
                <li>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision . If AET makes any future change to this
                    arbitration provision, other than a change to AET"s address for Notice of Arbitration,
                    you
                    may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to AET"s
                    address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with AET will be
                    immediately
                    terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes
                    you
                    rejected will survive.
                </li>
                <li>Enforceability. If Section 12.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this
                    Section 11 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 12 will be
                    null
                    and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue
                    described in Section 13.2 will govern any action arising out of or related to this
                    Agreement.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>ATFO Enforcement Rights. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING SECTIONS 7.3, 11 and 12, SHALL
            BIND THE ATFO TO THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS SET FORTH HEREIN NOR LIMIT THE ATFO"S RIGHT
            AND
            ABILITY TO AVAIL ITSELF OF ALL APPLICABLE RIGHTS AND REMEDIES, INCLUDING THOSE PROVIDED BY
            CHAPTER 366 AND CHAPTER 372 OF THE TEXAS TRANSPORTATION CODE, AS AMENDED, AND ANY OTHER
            APPLICABLE STATUTES CONFERRING RIGHTS AND REMEDIES FOR AN ATFO AND, IN SUCH INSTANCES, YOU WILL
            HAVE ALL OF THE RIGHTS PROVIDED THEREUNDER AND YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE COURTS
            EMPOWERED TO HEAR SUCH MATTERS SHALL ADJUDICATE SUCH MATTERS AND SUCH MATTERS WILL NOT BE
            ARBITRATED. If an ATFO exercises its rights and remedies under Chapter 366 and " Chapter 372 of
            the Texas Transportation Code, as amended, and under any other applicable statutes" conferring
            rights and remedies for any ATFO, each of AET and you hereby agree to waive any right to
            participate in, be a member of, or to serve as a representative for a class action with regard
            to any claim(s) they may have or assert against one another, and further agree that each of AET
            and you waive any right to have AET or your claims consolidated with, joined with, or combined
            with any claims of any other party or parties.
        </li>
        <li>Miscellaneous
            <ol class="list list_section">
                <li>General Terms. This Agreement, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements
                    expressly incorporated by reference into this Agreement are the entire and exclusive
                    understanding and agreement between you and AET regarding your use of the Service. You
                    may
                    not assign or transfer this Agreement or your rights under this Agreement, in whole or
                    in
                    part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign
                    this Agreement at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance
                    of
                    any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after
                    that,
                    nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of this Agreement, or any provision of
                    this
                    Agreement, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision
                    itself. Use of section headers in this Agreement is for convenience only and will not
                    have

                    part
                    will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will
                    remain in
